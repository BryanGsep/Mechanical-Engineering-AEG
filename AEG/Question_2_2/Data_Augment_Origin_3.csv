"For similat performance, two bladed is more ideal because the force will be canceled out and the manufacturing is cheaper",0,ITB,0,
The two blade wind turbine are the best choice from among all the others type in chart. The reason is the the two blade wind turbine can endure a large amount of wind speed than the other which is good for a strong wind meanwhile it is produce alot of power,0,SU,0,0
"The ideal turbine type for the condition could be propeller type, three blade wind turbine, and two blade wind turbine. ",0,SU,0,0
"Based on the figure above, the graph of Three-blade wind turbine is likely to be constant in their tip speed ratio. The graph has a vertex almost exactly in the mid, means that the back and forth rotation is constant. Other than that, the power coefficient of the graph is also high, means that the it is close to the ideal power efficiency for propeller-typewind turbine.",0,SU,0,0
"This wind turbine efficiency can be increased to get the maximum power coefficient. One of them is by using a large number of blades. This maximum system efficiency will increase the number of Watts (power) produced so that to get a certain number of watts it is enough to use a smaller number of windmills. Therefore, wind turbine is more ideal with three blades.",0,SU,0,1
"Three blades are ideal because they give better structural integrity rather than the two blade in terms of angular momentum. In some moments, the two blades of the wind turbine will wobble because of its structures and it will damage the rotor and the whole wind turbine installation ",0,SU,0,0
"Three Blades. Because the working principles of the rotor blades of these wind turbines are different. Airflow over the surfaces of a rotor blade creates lift and drag forces. A wind power generation turbine converts lift force into rotational torque, while a traditional windmill transforms drag force into rotational torque",0,UGM,0,0
"Three blade is more ideal than two blade. Because , the maximum values of three blade ",0,UGM,0,0
"Based on the graph, we can see that it is an experimental result that have been conducted by the researchers. Theoretically, 3 bladed wind turbines are usually more ideal. ",1,ITB,1,
"For that condition, i choose wind turbine with 3 blade because that velocity ratio is higher. 3 blade turbine have ideal for high velocity ratio than 2 blade turbine. Efficiency turbine with 3 blade more higher than 2 blade turbine.",1,ITB,1,
"Because the wind turbine with the tip speed ratio of 7.2 would have more power power coefficient and in the graph, the wind turbine which has tip speed ratio that reach 7.2 are two and three blades. The two blades wind turbine is more efficient.",1,SU,2,1
Because the tip speed of the rotor for both two and three rotor blade is the same. Two rotor blade is more ideal than three rotor blade as they are require less rotor blade but still produce the same tip speed ratio. ,1,SU,1,1
"It is true because the faster the blades move through the air, wind turbines with fewer blades because more blades slow down the turbine's rotation due to additional weight and wind resistance. It is based on the application. However, due to design in general, turbines with three or more blades have more consistent angular momentum. So it is more stable when it rorate. Furthermore, when one blade points up, the others point in an oblique direction, causing the turbine to rotate more smoothly in the wind.",1,SU,1,1
Two rotor blades are more ideal than three rotor blades. This is due to the higher tip speed ratio. Increasing the tip speed ratio will increase the power,1,SU,1,0
"The power coefficient is the same between the three-blade and two-blade wind turbines because the rotor blade actually moves based on the wind movement and velocity. Then, based on the diagram, having a three-blade is ideal enough rather than a two-blade turbine. Because the faster the turbine move, the higher the risk of the maintenance break.",1,SU,0,1
"3 blades is more ideal than 2 blades turbine. First, the 3 blades turbine can rotate slower than 2 blades turbine therefore the loud noise can be avoided. Second, since it is can rotate slower, during on extreme winds, the blades can be prevented to be damaged.",1,SU,1,1
I think the most ideal blade is two-bladed wind turbine as it covers a wide range area of the tip speed ratio and its power coef is the highest amongst other. ,1,SU,1,1
"Two blade wind turbine is more ideal than three blade. Because from the graph, values of power coeffiecient two blade higher than three bladephy",1,UGM,0,1
"The more ideal is three-bladed wind turbine, because it will produce smoother rotation and requires less inertia force to make it rotate from stationary position. The tip speed ratio is constant for two-bladed and three-bladed because it is not reliant on the number of speed (where it is stated that tip speed ratio is the ratio between the rotational speed of the tip of the blade and the velocity of the incident wind.) ",2,ITB,2,
Three blade is preferable because it will increase the stability of the wind rotation.,2,ITB,2,
"based on the power coefficient vs tip speed ratio, at speed ratio of 7.2 there's cross sectional between three-blade wind turbine and two-blade wind turbine. Three-blade wind turbine shows decreasing of power coefficient after the tip ratio approximately larger than six which means it not good at handling higher tip speed. Meanwhile, two-blade wind turbine is good at handling at higher tip speed ratio. Two-blade wind turbine is more ideal comparing to the three-blade because the power coefficient is consistently increase within the tip speed ratio. ",2,ITB,2,
"So the power coefficient of wind turbine with two or three blade have the same value when the tip speed ratio is 7.2, this result can happen, because with three blade, the turbine gain more force from blade to rotate the turbine, but with these three blade, the momen inertia of the blade is bigger than two blade with smaller resultant force. And the loss from three blade turbine was made this energy equal with two blade turbine which has two blade",2,ITB,2,
"Based on Figure 6, it could be seen that at the tip speed ratio of 7.2, there is an intersection of the three and two-blade wind turbines. This intersection indicates that the three and two-blade wind turbines have the same power coefficient at the tip speed ratio of 7.2. Therefore, the statement is true. Ideally, it is better to use the two-blade wind turbine if the tip speed ratio is around 7.2. As it could be seen in Figure 6, the two-blade wind turbine its power coefficient will increase as the tip speed ratio increases. It means, as the wind velocity increases, the generated power will also increase. On the other hand, the three-blade wind turbine will decrease if the tip speed ratio is more than 6.",2,SU,2,1
two-blade wind turbine is more ideal than three-blade wind turbine because its wider range of coverage hence more stable especially considering changes in weather that can cause changes in the tip ratio,2,UGM,2,2
"The two blades wind turbine have a better power coefficient than the three baldes wind turbin, and the two blades have a higher tip speed ratio. For me i think i will use the two blades because it generates a bigger power coefficient and a higher wind speed so it can also generate a bigger energy.",2,UGM,2,2
Wind turbines with a tip speed ratio of 7.2 will have virtually the same power coefficient whether they have two or three rotor blades because from figure 6 we know that three blade and two blade turbine have the same power coefficient,2,UGM,2,2
"with two or three blades, it may generate more efficient power generation. the three blades are more ideal because it has lower tip speed ratio but still has efficient power generation and less dangerous.",2,UGM,2,2
"This is true because incident wind velocity is enough for that parameter, and the blades’ rotation rate is in a good value also the rotational radius is ideal for this turbine. The three rotor blades are more ideal for turbine because it makes the rotation flow more efficient than the two one.",2,UGM,2,2
From the tip speed ratio graphic shown that two blade rotor have more efficient power generation because it have high value for the tip speed ratio. It can be generated that for the two blade rotor wind turbine can produce highest power generation at the low wind speed.,2,UGM,2,2

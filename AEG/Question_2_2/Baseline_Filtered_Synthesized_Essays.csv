"For better stability in the face of weather changes, two bladed turbines are more ideal than their three-blade counterpart due to wider range. This makes them a superior choice for turbine applications with variable tip ratios (such as seasonality).",2,0.047218237072229385,two-blade wind turbine is more ideal than three-blade wind turbine because its wider range of coverage hence more stable especially considering changes in weather that can cause changes in the tip ratio
"The two-blade wind turbine is more suitable than the three-brade one because it has a wider range and is therefore more stable, especially when weather conditions can cause fluctuations in the tip ratio.",2,0.046078938990831375,two-blade wind turbine is more ideal than three-blade wind turbine because its wider range of coverage hence more stable especially considering changes in weather that can cause changes in the tip ratio
"To ensure a suitable parameter, the turbine's rotational radius is ideal and its blade speed can be at least well adjusted to meet this requirement due to adequate wind velocity. The use of three rotor blades in turbine is preferred due to its ability to enhance rotational efficiency, unlike the usage of two.",2,0.0451246052980423,"This is true because incident wind velocity is enough for that parameter, and the blades’ rotation rate is in a good value also the rotational radius is ideal for this turbine. The three rotor blades are more ideal for turbine because it makes the rotation flow more efficient than the two one."

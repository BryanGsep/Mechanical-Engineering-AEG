"Small wind turbine can operate fine with just 1 blade because of the centrifugal force generated by that blade is relatively small and the rotor can handle that. For large wind power turbine with long and relatively heavy blade, the centrifugal force from only 1 blade could be enough to cause a major damage to the rotor due to large amount of force and vibration since the blade behaves similar to an unbalanced mass. By installing multiple blade, the force from each blade will cancel each other and thus total force in the rotor is reduced.",2,ITB,2,
"If wind turbine have more than 3 blades, then the weight will increase. This condition can affect of physical strength decrease. After that, wind turbine can fail when it operated. This can make risk of damage to the rotor blades.",1,ITB,1,
"In large wind turbines, the radial length from the rotor blade tip to the rotor axis of rotation is also longer. The longer the radial length - taking into account constant angular velocity - produces higher torque as well. That is why for large wind turbines, we don't need that much of rotor blades because the torque produced by each rotor blade is sufficient already ",0,ITB,0,
"A combination of structural and economic considerations drives the use of three slender blades on most wind turbines. 2 or 3 blades means that the angular momentum would stay constant with one blade pointing upwards, the other two pointing at an angle.  ",0,ITB,0,
The torque need to rotate the blade at large wind turbine is big so large wind turbine need more than one blade to increase the stability of rotation.,0,ITB,0,
"Because big inertia of rotor, if we use more than three, the stress of the shaft will be huge",0,ITB,0,
"Because large turbine usually has more focused on length of the blade rather the amounf of blade the turbine has. Since large turbine usually has more longer blade so to give the optimum spaces for the blades, the total amount of blades should be fewer.",0,ITB,0,
"First because if there any failure or damage for example like the blade fell to the ground, this accident can be very dangerous to people around there. And the second one, due to large wind power generation turbine have a big cost of investation, so if there any failure happen, it can lead to loss (in the term of money)",0,ITB,0,
"Large wind power generation turbines normally have two or three blades to keep it balanced while rotating. In addition, with 2 or 3 blades, the turbine can survive in big winds because it can move slower, compared if the blades is only one, so that the damage can be minimized while the power generated from the turbine is still adequate.",2,SU,2,2
"A large turbine would require a larger blades to generate the rotor. A larger blade is considered for absorbing a larger amount of forces from the wind velocity, convert it into drag forces and torque. Adding more of this LARGE blades would result into more energy or force requirement in rotating the mechanism, therefore there are only 2-3 blades for a large wind power. smaller wind power instead, they are focusing on the angular velocity that should be created in generating the rotor. Therefore, they have a lighter blade, yet also much more than the larger one.",1,SU,1,0
"The rotor blades in a large wind turbine will resist much more wind force against it due to their wide area. Besides, a long rotor blade will have to resist a huge bending moment since its perpendicular distance of the wind force is very long. Therefore, large turbines will have a higher risk of failure in the rotor blades.",1,SU,1,1
"The high number of blades increases the weight of the system. If the system is too heavy, it can produce higher stress which leads to failure. Furthermore, high number of blades increases production cost",1,SU,1,1
"A large turbine surely has a high pillar or pole. If the pillar carries too heavy and large blades, it can break the pillar easily. Therefore, it has a higher risk of failure in the structure because of the height itself. Besides, maintenance will be harder to take if there are more than 3 blades in the large wind power generation turbines.",1,SU,1,1
This is the case to minimize possible defects on the rotor blades that may lead to failure.,1,SU,0,1
"Three blades are chosen because it is related to the drag generated as the wind face the blades. More blades will increase the drag force. In addition, having more blades will increase the risk of collapse caused by their weight. Moreover, having more blades makes the air instead of passing through the blade and making the lift force, the air will cause turbulence. ",1,SU,1,1
larger wind power generator means that the working radius is larger also. It means that the rotor blades need more power by the wind to move them. Adding more blades could give a result to add more mass the the blades and a larger area of contact. A larger area of contact could be possibly to break the rotor blades.,0,SU,0,0
"The using of two or three rotor blades is whenever it is added by other rotor blades it will increasing the mass of the windmill because of the blades length which cause the inertia of the rotor blades and the windmill compare to the smaller blades of the smaller windmill. If the larger windmill added more blades on it, it will increase the total weight of the rotor blades.",0,SU,0,0
"Smaller wind power generation turbines has fewer rotor blade as they are relatively easier to rotate, however with large wind power generation turbine they have motor rotor blade to help it keep spinning and produce more power. ",0,SU,0,0
"Turbines with three blades are more stable, with more constant angular momentum. Furthermore, when one blade points up, the others point at an angle, causing the turbine to rotate more smoothly in the wind.
While turbine that has 1 blade is inefficient and impractical",0,SU,0,0
"The longest we have the length will result in a higher moment of inertia. The energy produced will also be higher considering the speed of the blades. If the speed is too high, it will be dangerous. If the wind is too small, it will resulting in uneffective movement of the blades (because the speed is faster than the big one) and the energy produced will be smaller.",0,SU,0,1
A wind turbine is a device capable of converting wind energy into mechanical energy and then converting it into electrical energy through a generator. This wind turbine efficiency can be increased to get the maximum power coefficient. One of them is by using a large number of blades. This maximum system efficiency will increase the number of Watts (power) produced so that to get a certain number of watts it is enough to use a smaller number of windmills.,0,SU,0,0
"Large wind power generation turbine only has two or three blades. In that case, there is some of factors that account, that is physical strength and risk of damage. Cause of wind power generational turbine has large size, so the residual stress that occur on the rotor blades is bigger than the smaller size of turbine. That because, large wind power turbine has higher weight and the drag force that applied on the rotor blades are bigger. If more rotor blades added into large wind power generation turbine, so drag force that applied on the rotor blades are increase, then also increase the residual stress on the rotor blades.",2,UGM,1,2
large wind power generation carries great load on its shaft since larger diameter will increase the torque of wind turbine. considering the already high torque further investment on the shaft will be a waste since the material required needs to be stronger and more expensive,2,UGM,1,2
"with two or three rotor blades, it provides more strength and stability compared to the four or more rotor blades. In case of an accident, the two or three rotor blades are easier to maintained and repaired ",2,UGM,2,2
"the construction of large wind turbine usually have two or three rotor blades cause in large size wind turbine, there is some factor that can make the phsycal strength of the wind turbine is down. In the large size rotor blade, the drag force that occur in each blade is larger than the smaller blade. so if there is more than three blades, the stress and force that occur in wind turbine blades is getting bigger and can damaged the construction.",2,UGM,2,2
"with two or three blades, it may generate more efficient power generation. Large wind power generation turbines normally have two or three rotor blades, because it is more safety to the peoples at the turbine are. ",2,UGM,1,2
"Large turbines need more winds power to rotate especially because their scale is bigger than the smaller one, so that two or three rotor blades is enough for this turbine to rotate efficiently. More rotor blades can make the turbines difficult to rotate. ",2,UGM,1,2
"why the smaller one not have two or three rotor blades? it because the smaller one can't produce the high level of torque that the large turbines can produces, so, if the amount of blade is more then the larger turbine, the rpm can produce haigher than the large turbine, so the smaller rotor blade have more blades can produce the better torque than 1 or 3 blades",1,UGM,0,1
Because large turbines have a relative velocity between the rotor blades and the incident wind is determined by the rotation of the blades. The lift-to-drag ratio increases to its maximum as a function of the angle of attack: the angle between the chord line of the airfoil. If small turbines need a many blade.,1,UGM,1,1
"The more rotor blades there are in a wind power generation turbines, the starting speed or the acceleration of the blades are decrease. So for large turbines like in this case, the wind power generation turbines can use only two or three rotor blades so it can maximize the speed of the rotor blades to swing and generate more power.",1,UGM,1,1
"Because for making power generation turbines, that must did by continously where evever in this case rotor blades must keep rotating and finally mechanic's energy can conserve to electrical's energy.",1,UGM,0,1
"The blade can convert the wind force to any force such as rotational torque, with the geometry the blade is twisted make the blade can produce more force from any angle wind when contact the blade. In large power generator, it uses to produce large energy. because that, for produce large energy the power generator turbine can use more than one blade. Use two or three rotor blades can generate more wind force to tortional torque and produce more energy",1,UGM,1,1
because large turbines have very large winds to absorb kinetic energy in the rotor which functions to absorb the energy generated in the wind,1,UGM,0,1
"In the large wind power generation turbine, with large turbine normally have two or three rotor blades this for make the turbine more efficient in generate power. With more rotor blade the limit temperature for blade material can solve. With more rotors also increase the relative velocity and make the speed turbine more high.",1,UGM,1,1
"The theory said, to make big power generation needs to have higher rotational torsion velocity. So, it must re-bulid the wind turbine to bigger diameter or dimension rotor blade in the same parameter of quantity. So, to limit the compact dimension, there are made more construction of rotor blades to reach higher torsion velocity.",1,UGM,1,1
Large wind power generation turbines normally have two or three rotor blades,0,UGM,0,0

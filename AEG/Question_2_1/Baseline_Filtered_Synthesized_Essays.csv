In case of an accident, the two or three rotor blades are easier to maintained and repaired "
"Despite the use of two or three rotor blades, wind turbines in their construction can still be harmful to their physical properties. Why? In contrast to the smaller rotor blade, each has a greater drag force that affects it. Having more than three wind turbine blades can lead to increased stress and force, which in turn can cause damage to the construction.",2,0.47917071,"the construction of large wind turbine usually have two or three rotor blades cause in large size wind turbine, there is some factor that can make the phsycal strength of the wind turbine is down. In the large size rotor blade, the drag force that occur in each blade is larger than the smaller blade. so if there is more than three blades, the stress and force that occur in wind turbine blades is getting bigger and can damaged the construction."
"Since many big windsor generators have only one or more rotator blade on each turbine, there are some factors that can make them less effective for blowing power. While each large-sized rotor blade experiences more drag forces, the smaller one is not as effective due to its size. In case wind turbine blades are enlarged beyond three, they may experience more strain and force that could potentially harm their construction.",2,0.476579428,"the construction of large wind turbine usually have two or three rotor blades cause in large size wind turbine, there is some factor that can make the phsycal strength of the wind turbine is down.

"Circulating a large-scale turbine requires more wind power, which means that two or three rotor blades are sufficient for its efficient operation. This can make it more difficult to rotate the turbines, as there are many rotor blade sizes.",2,0.476576596,"Large turbines need more winds power to rotate especially because their scale is bigger than the smaller one, so that two or three rotor blades is enough for this turbine to rotate efficiently. More rotor blades can make the turbines difficult to rotate. "
"The rotor of a small wind turbine can handle the centrifugal force generated by slicing off if there is only one blade, making it efficient. When dealing with a wind power turbine with one blade that is long and heavy, the centrifugal force from all of its components could cause significant damage to the rotor due to excessive force and vibration, as the entire rotating blade behaves like an unbalanced mass. The installation of multiple blades will result in a decrease in the total force in this rotor, as the force from each blade will cancel out.",2,0.476207376,"Small wind turbine can operate fine with just 1 blade because of the centrifugal force generated by that blade is relatively small and the rotor can handle that. For large wind power turbine with long and relatively heavy blade, the centrifugal force from only 1 blade could be enough to cause a major damage to the rotor due to large amount of force and vibration since the blade behaves similar to an unbalanced mass. By installing multiple blade, the force from each blade will cancel each other and thus total force in the rotor is reduced."
"It is essential to have enough wind power in large turbines for them not only on their scale but also on the same size scale, so they require at least two or three rotor blade rotation areas. Winding up the turbines becomes increasingly difficult with an increase in rotor blade numbers.",2,0.475887567,"Large turbines need more winds power to rotate especially because their scale is bigger than the smaller one, so that two or three rotor blades is enough for this turbine to rotate efficiently. More rotor blades can make the turbines difficult to rotate. "
"It is possible for a small wind turbine to operate with only one blade because the centrifugal force generated by that blade is relatively small and can be handled by the rotor. There is a possibility that the centrifugal force exerted by one wind turbine blade could cause significant damage to the rotor due to its unbalanced mass and high centrifuge force. Each blade's force will be offset by the rotor when it is installed, leading to reduced force.",2,0.472530127,"Small wind turbine can operate fine with just 1 blade because of the centrifugal force generated by that blade is relatively small and the rotor can handle that.
